- Review the existing code (rewrite it completely if it's crap - it should be a simple project, don't do anything crazy - everything should be in a SINGLE file)
- Update the demo - change the font, the color-scheme, etc
- Setup a sub-domain parallax.djordjejocic.com pointing with a demo
- Use CSS pre-loaders instead GIFs - add an option to custom IMG preloaders (animated or not) - there should be a rotation switch
- Make a generator for the demo, and a YouTube video about it
- Prepare 2.0 release
- Update readme file
